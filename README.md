# This project captured realtime data from multiple types of sensors around industrial sites, then provided a GUI to view the data in multiple forms and fast 
# analysis tools so issues during operatons could be quickly identified and decisions made. Data was stored in a custom DB so historic data could be viewed and
# trends spotted / issues identified. It ran for several years without bugs, and included an encrypted TCP connection to another running instance in
# the company offices that allowed managers/staff to view the site's operations and data in realtime.
